                                <p> Analyzing and gaining insights from a large amount of textual conversations can be quite challenging for a user, especially when the discussions become very long. During my doctoral research, I have focused on integrating Information Visualization (InfoVis) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to better support the user's task of exploring and analyzing conversations. For this purpose, I have designed a visual text analytics system that supports the user exploration, starting from a possibly large set of conversations, then narrowing down to a subset of conversations, and eventually drilling-down to a set of comments of one conversation. While so far our approach is evaluated mainly based on lab studies, in my on-going and future work I plan to evaluate our approach via online longitudinal studies. </p>

                                <p>There is increasing evidence that user characteristics can have a significant impact on visualization effectiveness, suggesting that visualizations could be designed to better fit each user’s specific needs. Most studies to date, however, have looked at static visualizations. Studies considering interactive visualizations have only looked at a limited number of user characteristics, and consider either low-level tasks (e.g., value retrieval), or high-level tasks (in particular: discovery), but not both. This paper contributes to this line of work by looking at the impact of a large set of user characteristics on user performance with interactive visualizations, for both low and high-level tasks. We focus on interactive visualizations that support decision-making, exemplified by a visualization known as Value Charts. We include in the study two versions of ValueCharts that differ in layout, to ascertain whether layout mediates the impact of individual differences and could be considered as a form of personalization. Our  key findings are that (i)  performance with low and high-level tasks is affected by different user characteristics (ii) users with low visual working memory perform better with a horizontal layout. We discuss how these findings can inform the provision of personalized support to visualization processing.</p>

							<h3>Concept-based image search and exploration</h3><br />
							<p>
Even though Web image search queries are often ambiguous, traditional search
engines promote only the most common interpretations of the query, which makes it
diﬃcult for the searcher to ﬁnd the desired images. For addressing this problem, a
concept-based query expansion technique is used to generate a diverse range of images
covering multiple interpretations of the query. Then, a multi-resolution extension of
a Self-Organizing Map is used to group conceptually and visually similar images.<br>

The resulting interface allows
the searcher to interactively highlight and ﬁlter images based on the concepts and
zoom into an area within the image space to show additional images that are similar.
Finally, a query reﬁnement approach is proposed, which enables enhancement of
queries based on explicitly selecting concepts or extracting concepts from example
images. A series of evaluations illustrate the potential beneﬁts of the system.  <br><br>
